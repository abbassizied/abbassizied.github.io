### 🔥🚀 About Me 

👋 Hello! I'm a seasoned Full Stack Developer with over 10 years of experience, currently working at the Company of Phosphates of GAFSA (CPG), Tunisia. I specialize in building scalable, cloud-native applications using Java, Angular, and a strong DevOps toolchain.

💻 I thrive in complex environments that require elegant technical solutions, clean architecture, and continuous deployment. My experience spans microservices, modern frontend frameworks, cloud infrastructures, and even the exciting frontier of AI/ML integration.

☁️ As a DevOps practitioner, I embrace automation and cloud-native design with tools like Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform—ensuring efficient CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code, and high-performance deployments.

🧠 I'm deeply passionate about artificial intelligence, machine learning, NLP, and deep learning. Whether it’s predictive maintenance or AI-driven optimization, I’m always pushing toward smarter systems.

🎯 I bring a systems-thinking mindset combined with agile collaboration, making me a valuable team player in cross-functional environments.
